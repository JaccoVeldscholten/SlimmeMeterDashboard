# Smart Meter (P1) Dashboard Hardware

A piece of hardware is required to read the smart meter from the P1 Port. Depending on the DSMR version, there are different ways to read the meter.

- **All Versions**

In my case I developed two designs. One is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero for the older DSMR versions. This design also works on the latest DSMR version.

- **DSMR 4 and Up**

Another option is to use the printed circuit board designed for this project. This circuit board is drawn in Altium Designer. This PCB only works for DSMR 4 and above because it has no external power supply. With a small adjustment this can of course be made yourself.

## Raspberry Pi Zero
ToDo will be added
